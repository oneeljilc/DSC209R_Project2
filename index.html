          <figcaption>A scatterplot comparing the % decrease in abortion vs. the % loss of abortion clinics, from 2017 to 2020.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Data Transformation:</u> Reducing the dataset</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -1.5</li>
              <li>I reduced the dataset to include only those states where the number of abortion clinics 
                decreased (i.e., ['% change in the no. of abortion clinics, 2017-2020'] < 0) since this is the
                heart of the proposition. This means the graph will no longer include instances where the 
                number of abortion clinics increased, but the abortion rate decreased. These data points 
                directly contradict the proposition so leaving them out is deceptive.</li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by focusing the reader on only the data 
                that potentially supports the proposition. I think this more focused dataset works well; 
                however, astute readers will probably notice that the visualization has less than 50 data 
                points (for all 50 states) and may wonder what the missing data says.</li>
                <li>As an alternative, I considered plotting all of that data anyway and relying more heavily 
                  on the annotations/trendline, but I found that the plot was too busy and it made my other
                decisions seemed more obviously deceptive.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><u>Data Transformation:</u> Calculating new column</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -0.5</li>
              <li>I added a new column of data called "% Loss in abortion clinics (2017 to 2020)" that is the 
                ['% change in the no. of abortion clinics, 2017-2020'] * -1. Since my previous design decision 
                left me with only states that lost abortion clinics (i.e., % change is negative), this data 
                transformation simply makes the % change positive. I don't believe that this is a major 
                deception; however, I am slightly adjusting the data to tell a more persuasive story which 
                feels mildly deceptive.
              </li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by allowing me to plot the data in the 
                4th quadrant (x is +, y is -). This means that in support of the proposition, an increase in 
                the loss of clinics (x) should result in a decrease in the abortion rate (y). This allows for 
                an intuitive "down-and-to-the-right" trend which most English readers associate with a decrease.
              </li>
                <li>As an alternative, I considered plotting in the other three coordinates, including the 
                  3rd coordinate of the original data (x is -, y is -), but found that the "decreasing" trend 
                  I am trying to support was not as immediately clear. In fact, in the original data, it 
                  almost looks like an "increasing" trend as the line goes "up-and-to-the-right" when viewed 
                  left to right, as in traditional in Enlgish reading.
                </li>
            </ul>
          <li><u>Annotation:</u> Linear Trendline</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -2.0</li>
              <li>I added a linear fit trendline to the data and made it a solid red in order to stand out 
                confidently against the gray data. This decision feels the most deceptive for a few reasons. 
                First, this trendline is exactly what my proposition is asserting and while it comes <em>from</em> 
                the data, it is not data itself. Second, it is actually not a very good fit for this data and I 
                purposely did not include or report a "goodness of fit" metric like R-squared.
              </li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by visually asserting that my proposition 
                is true and guiding readers to see the trend that I want them to see. While the linear fit is 
                actually not very good per the R-squared value, I think it doesn't look too deceptive on the plot. 
                especially with the reduced dataset per my first design choice.
              </li>
                <li>As an alternative, I considered no trendline or a more complex fit (like polynomial). With 
                  no trendline, I was relying too much on Text (title/subtitle, annotations) to assert my 
                  proposition. Additionally, more complex trendlines actually seemed more deceptive and 
                  countered my rather simple proposition.
                </li>
            </ul>
          <li><u>Annotation:</u> Color & Highlight key outliers</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -0.5</li>
              <li>I used coloring and annotations to highlight a few key states that really support my 
                proposition, while reducing emphasis on those states that don't really support it.
              </li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by drawing the reader to the data and 
                trend that I want them to see. I choose to highlight states where my proposition is especially 
                true. I also chose to highlight the same kinds of states (i.e., southern and conservative) in 
                order to potentially capiltalize on reader bias towards abortion care in those states.
              </li>
                <li>As an alternative, I considered coloring the states by region but found that this overcomplicated 
                  the plot without providing additional persuasiveness.

          <figcaption>A bar plot comparing the % change in abortion rate for state's that did not see a change in the number of abortion clinics, from 2017 to 2020.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Data Transformation:</u> Reducing the dataset</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -0.5</li>
              <li>I reduced the dataset to include only those states where the number of abortion clinics 
                did not change (i.e., ['% change in the no. of abortion clinics, 2017-2020'] == 0). I find this 
                to be mildly deceptive because it does exclude the data at the heart of the proposition which 
                are states where the number of abortion clinics decreased. However, the intention is to disprove the 
                proposition by showing instances where the decrease in abortion rate has nothing to do with the 
              loss of clinics.</li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by focusing the reader on only the data 
                that potentially contradicts the proposition. I think this more focused dataset works well; 
                however, astute readers will probably notice the limited scope of the data.</li>
              <li>As an alternative, I considered plotting the data where the number of clinics increased and 
                the abortion rate still decreased; however, this only happened in 2 states.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><u>Data Transformation:</u> Sorting the dataset</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: 1.5</li>
              <li>I sorted the data so that the bars will be in descending order left-to-right (i.e.,  
                subset.sort_values('% change in abortion rate, 2017-2020', ascending=False)). I don't 
              think this is a deceptive decision, it just makes the bars more pleasing to look at.</li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by clearly showing the wide range of 
                abortion rates among states with no change to the number of clinics.
              </li>
              <li>As an alternative, I considered ordering the bars by alphabetical order or region, but I 
                actually found this to be less convincing and more chaotic. It was harder to visualize how much the 
                rates actually vary.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li><u>Annotation:</u> Color Scale</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: 0.5</li>
              <li>I added a red-blue color scale to the bars such that very positive numbers are more red, numbers 
                close to zero are more gray, and very negative numbers are more blue. This doesn't feel deceptive 
                because it is simply emphasizing the height of the bars which are already visible. It is also 
                emphasizing that the range of values is quite large, spanning highly positive to highly negative.
              </li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by clearly emphasizing the range in values and 
                that there is no clear trend. Meaning that states saw a range of outcomes, including significant 
                decreases in abortion rates, despite no real change in the number of clinics.
              </li>
              <li>As an alternative, I considered no color scale and putting the % numbers directly on the bars, but the 
                color scale felt a lot cleaner and easier to pick up on at a glance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li><u>Annotation:</u> Text</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: 2.0</li>
              <li>I added a text box that highlights the range in values, as described in the previous design 
                decisions. I don't think this is deceptive because it simply points out an earnest observation 
                of the data.
              </li>
              <li>This decision makes my visualization more persuasive by clearly describing to the reader the 
                basis of my "Against" proposition, instead of relying on them to come to the observation on 
                their own. I think this annotation works well because it looks very clean and professional on the graph.
              </li>
              <li>As an alternative, I considered no annotation and also different formats of this annotation. 
                Ultimately, I liked the simple look of a shadowed text box in the white space of the graph. The way that
                the bars are organized leaves the perfect white space on the chart to fill with an annotation like this one.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>Overall, I found the initial data exploration and deciding on a propsition to be the most difficult 
          part of this project. Specifically because we had to argue for both sides and that's not an exercise I am 
          very accustomed to. My background is in materials science and in my work, the data either supports your 
          hypothesis or it doesn't. Additionally, we have standardized data analysis methods and data visualizations. It 
          would be considered highly unethical and potentially fraudulent to employ some of the more deceptive techniques 
          we have learned about in the lectures. Ultimately, I tried to select a proposition where the case for/against seemed to be
          more balanced; however, I still found myself biased toward the side that I felt was best supported by the data. 
          Specifically, I felt that the data did <u>not</u> support my proposition that: <em>States that lost abortion clinics saw 
            the largest declines in abortion rates.</em> Once I determined my proposition, I found making the visualizations and 
            applying the concepts we learned in class regarding visualization types, color, annotations, etc. 
            to be fairly straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>What surprised me the most was that my bias as to which side I felt was best supported by the data 
          influenced the deceptiveness scores that I ended up giving to the design decisions for each graph. At first, 
          I scored everything for the "For" visualization as highly negative (i.e., deceptive) and everything for the "Against" 
          visualization as highly positive (i.e., earnest). However, upon reflection, I adjusted some of my scores
